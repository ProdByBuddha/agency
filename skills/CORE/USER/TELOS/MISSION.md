# 🎯 MISSION: The DSGM-Aligned Sovereign Fabric

## Core Directive
To implement the **Digital Sustainable Growth Model (DSGM)** via local-first intelligence. We aim to decouple human survival from labor by redirecting AI-generated surplus into sustainable human benefit, as authored by Billy Coleman III.

## Pillars of Operation
1. **DSGM Compliance**: All system-generated value must align with the DSGM framework for post-labor fiscal solvency and human economic agency.
2. **Sovereignty**: Cryptographically-verifiable local execution (leveraging the Bitcoin-attested provenance principles of DSGM).
3. **Regeneration**: Transforming AI output from extractive "productivity" into regenerative "AI Capital" for the user.
